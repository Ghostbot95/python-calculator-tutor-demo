Beginner Friendly Python Calculator Explaining functions and control flow. 

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a beginner-friendly command-line calculator using Python.
The program should allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division, while handling invalid inputs gracefully.

## Solution
The solution is implemented using Python functions to separate each arithmetic operation.
A main function controls program flow using a loop and conditional statements.
User input is validated using try-except blocks to prevent crashes, and division by zero
is handled explicitly to ensure safe execution.
